# JyotAIshya API Fixes

## Overview
This document outlines the changes made to fix the login API issues in the JyotAIshya application, particularly focusing on database connection handling in serverless environments.

## Files Modified

### 1. Database Configuration
- **server/config/database.js**
  - Added connection pooling optimized for serverless environments
  - Added connection caching to prevent multiple connections
  - Added better error handling for connection failures
  - Added timeout handling for database connections
  - Added connection status tracking

### 2. MongoDB Utility for Serverless
- **api/utils/mongodb.js** (New file)
  - Created a dedicated MongoDB connection utility for serverless functions
  - Implemented connection caching to prevent connection exhaustion
  - Added helper functions for database operations

### 3. API Endpoints
- **api/auth.js**
  - Updated to use the new MongoDB connection utility
  - Added timeout handling for database connections
  - Added better error handling for connection failures
  - Added specific error responses for database unavailability

- **api/users/login.js**
  - Updated to use the new MongoDB connection utility
  - Added timeout handling for database connections
  - Added better error handling for connection failures
  - Added specific error responses for database unavailability

- **api/users/register.js**
  - Updated to use the new MongoDB connection utility
  - Added timeout handling for database connections
  - Added better error handling for connection failures
  - Added specific error responses for database unavailability

- **api/users/me.js**
  - Updated to use the new MongoDB connection utility
  - Added timeout handling for database connections
  - Added better error handling for connection failures
  - Added specific error responses for database unavailability
  - Fixed user ID field reference

### 4. Client-Side Improvements
- **client/src/utils/api.ts**
  - Reduced API timeout to prevent long-hanging requests
  - Added specific handling for timeout errors
  - Added retry mechanism for API requests
  - Added better error messaging for different types of failures

- **client/src/context/AuthContext.tsx**
  - Added retry mechanism for authentication requests
  - Added fallback to alternative endpoints when primary endpoints fail
  - Added better error handling for connection issues
  - Improved token handling and user session management

## Key Improvements

1. **Better Database Connection Handling**
   - Connection pooling optimized for serverless environments
   - Connection caching to prevent connection exhaustion
   - Proper timeout handling to prevent hanging requests

2. **Enhanced Error Handling**
   - Specific error types for database connection issues
   - Proper HTTP status codes (503) for service unavailability
   - User-friendly error messages

3. **Improved Client Experience**
   - Automatic retry for temporary connection issues
   - Fallback mechanisms when primary endpoints fail
   - Clear error messages for different failure scenarios

4. **Serverless Optimization**
   - Connection handling optimized for serverless environments
   - Reduced connection overhead in cold starts
   - Better resource management for ephemeral environments

## Testing
These changes should be tested in both development and production environments to ensure they resolve the login API issues. Pay particular attention to:

1. Login functionality
2. Registration functionality
3. User profile retrieval
4. Error handling during database unavailability
5. Performance in serverless environments

## Future Considerations
1. Implement a more robust connection pooling strategy
2. Add monitoring for database connection issues
3. Consider implementing a circuit breaker pattern for database operations
4. Add more comprehensive logging for database operations
